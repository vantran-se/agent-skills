# Agent Skills


[**Agent Skills**](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/agents-and-tools/agent-skills/overview) are specialized workflows that empower Claude to perform complex, multi-step tasks with precision and reliability. They combine mission briefs, guardrails, and integration hints to transform generic AI assistance into disciplined automation.

> Skills leverage Claude's VM environment to provide capabilities beyond what's possible with prompts alone. Claude operates in a virtual machine with filesystem access, allowing Skills to exist as directories containing instructions, executable code, and reference materials, organized like an onboarding guide you'd create for a new team member.
> 
> This filesystem-based architecture enables **progressive disclosure**: Claude loads information in stages as needed, rather than consuming context upfront.
